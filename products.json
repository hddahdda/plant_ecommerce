They are commonly called calatheas or (like their relatives) prayer plants. About 200 species formerly assigned to Calathea are now in the genus Goeppertia.[1] There are several dozen species in this genus. Native to the tropical Americas, many of the species are popular as pot plants due to their decorative leaves and, in some species, colorful inflorescences. The young leaves and bracts can retain pools of water, called phytotelmata, that provide habitat for many invertebrates.[2]\r\n\r\nText from Wikipedia", "product_image": "calathea1_61sMEZX.jpeg"}}, {"model": "products.product", "pk": 2, "fields": {"category": 2, "name": "white_flowerpot", "friendly_name": "White Flowerpot", "sku": "2", "price": "17.00", "description": "A white medium-sized flowerpot.", "product_image": "whitewase_LOG7mDM.jpeg"}}, {"model": "products.product", "pk": 3, "fields": {"category": 1, "name": "flower", "friendly_name": "Flower", "sku": "3", "price": "135.00", "description": "A flower", "product_image": "heather_LWdgQ6s.jpeg"}}, {"model": "products.product", "pk": 5, "fields": {"category": 1, "name": "snakeplant", "friendly_name": "Snakeplant", "sku": "4", "price": "17.00", "description": "Dracaena trifasciata is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to tropical West Africa from Nigeria east to the Congo.
